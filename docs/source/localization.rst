Localization
============

Event analysis in InfraPy uses the Bayesian Infrasonic Source Localization (BISL) methodology to estimate both the spatial location of the event as well as the origin time with quantified uncertainty. Preliminary analysis of the back projections can be used to define the spatial region of interest.  The analysis identifies the maximum posteriori solution and also marginalizes a subset of the parameters to produce spatial and temporal distributions for the source.  Likelihood definitions relating detection parameters to spatial and temporal source characteristics are shared between association and localization analysis for consistency.
