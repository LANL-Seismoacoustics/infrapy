Association
===========================

* Events are identified using a pair-based Bayesian algorithm that defines the association between detection pairs from their joint-likelihood and identifies events via hierarchical clustering analysis
* Current implementation utilizes only spatial and temporal coincidence, but additional detection information can further improve event identification
* Evaluation using a synthetic data set shows some mixing of spatially similar events poorly resolved by network geometry and occasional inclusion of "noise" detections in event clustering
