Welcome to Infrapy's documentation.  InfraPy is a Python-based tool for processing infrasound data using automated or interactive means.  Following :ref:`installation`, it's recommended to work through the :ref:`quickstart` and :ref:`utilities` included in the package.  Information is also provided to use InfraPy's Graphical User Interface (GUI), :ref:`infraview`.

Infrapy is a tool for processing infrasound data that includes array-centric beamforming and detection methods, event identification via pair-based agglomeration, and Bayesian localization and characterization methods.  InfraPy is implemented to be relatively data agnostic so that analysis can be performed using locally stored files, data pull from an FDSN such as IRIS, or data locally stored in a relational database.  The InfraPy command line interface (CLI) is useful for pipeline analysis to run automated signal detection, event identification, and event characterization.  The InfraView GUI is more aimed at event-of-interest analysis where interactive interrogation of waveform data is needed and detections rapidly visualized for analysis.
