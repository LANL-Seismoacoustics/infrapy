@article{LePichon:2009,
	Abstract = {A global‐scale analysis of detections made at all 36 currently operating International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasound arrays confirms that the primary factor controlling signal detectability is the seasonal variability of the stratospheric zonal wind. At most arrays, ∼80\% of the detections in the 0.2‐ to 2‐Hz bandpass are associated with propagation downwind of the dominant stratospheric wind direction. Previous IMS infrasound network performance models neglect the time‐ and site‐dependent effects of both stratospheric meteorological variability and ambient noise models. In this study both effects are incorporated; we compare empirical and improved specifications of the stratospheric wind and include station‐dependent wind noise models. Using a deterministic approach, the influence of individual model parameters on the network performance is systematically assessed. At frequencies of interest for detecting atmospheric explosions (0.2--2 Hz), the simulations predict that explosions equivalent to ∼500 t of TNT would be detected by at least two stations at any time of the year. The detection capability is best around January and July when stratospheric winds are strongest, compared to the equinox periods when zonal winds reduce and reverse. The model predicts that temporal fluctuations in the ground‐to‐stratosphere meteorological variables generate detection threshold variations on daily and seasonal timescales of ∼50 and ∼500 t, respectively. While the strong zonal winds lead to an improvement in detection capability, their highly directional nature leads to an increase in the location uncertainty owing to the decreased azimuthal separation of the detecting stations.},

	Abstract = {We study the application of an infrasonic method to detect infrasonic acoustic emission caused by the destruction of glaciers in the Arctic. We consider the main approaches and methods for automatic signal detection from the data of infrasonic microarrays from the viewpoint of their practical use in conditions of frequent and significant variations in the noise level characteristics of the Arctic coast. We propose a novel method for the automatic detection of infrasonic events based on representation of a plane wave signal and adaptive estimation of the noise level. The method makes it possible to detect signals with a small number of sensors (up to three) in the specific conditions of the Arctic coast. We present the results of infrasonic monitoring of the destruction of Icefjord outlet glaciers (Spitsbergen archipelago) carried out by the Kola Branch of the RAS Geophysical Survey in 2011--2012.},

	Annote = {A Hough Transform technique is used to detect straight lines in array processing results, which are indicative of low SNR events.  This technique improves automatic detection of low SNR events while keeping a low false alarm rate. A new method based on binomial distribution and noise investigation is introduced to define suitable settings for the Hough Transform.  The Hough Transform is applied to beamforming results over a sliding Hough Window, and counts how many pairs of backazimuth results have the same slope-intercept parameters within a Hough Window.  The method is tested on three synthetic datasets; the first consisting of incoherent noise to evaluate the false alarm rate, the second and third with a long transient signal and a repetitive impulse source of different amplitudes.

	Abstract = {The prototype International Data Centre (IDC) in Arlington, Virginia has been acquiring data from seismic stations at locations designated in the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty for the International Monitoring System (IMS) since the start of 1995. A key characteristic of these stations is their background noise levels and their seasonal and diurnal variability. Since June 1997 an automated sample selection effort has collected over 700,000 individual noise sample spectra from 39 primary and 57 auxiliary stations. Monthly median and 5 and 95 percentile estimates have been calculated for each channel of every station. Compatibility of median spectra obtained for the same station and channel in the same month for two different years confirms the consistency of the noise-sampling algorithm used. A preliminary analysis of the results shows strong (more than a factor of two) seasonal variation at a quarter of all stations. Strong diurnal variations at half of the sites indicate that many of the selected sites are poorly located with respect to cultural noise sources. The results of this study are already being used to evaluate station quality, improve those processes that require background noise values, such as automatic association and requesting auxiliary station data, and to improve the estimation of station and network detection and location thresholds.},

@article{Brown:2002,
	Abstract = { --- This paper describes an automatic and interactive data processing system designed to locate impulsive atmospheric sources with a yield of at least one kiloton by detecting and characterizing the airborne infrasound radiated by the source. The infrasonic processing subsystem forms part of a larger system currently under development at the Prototype International Data Center (PIDC) in Arlington, Virginia where seismic, hydroacoustic, radionuclide and infrasonic methods are used to detect and locate impulsive sources in any terrestrial environment. Infrasonic signal detection is achieved via a coincidence detector which requires both the normalized cross correlation and the short-term-average/long-term-average ratio of a beam in the direction of maximum correlation to exceed predetermined threshold values simultaneously before a detection is declared. The infrasound propagation model currently used to infer travel-time information assumes the horizontal sound speed across the ground to be 320.0{\thinspace}m/s. This crude model is currently being replaced by a model which predicts travel-time information through a ray-tracing algorithm for acoustic waves in an atmosphere with seasonal representations for temperature and wind. A novel feature of the source location process is the fusion of all available arrival information, whether it be seismic, hydroacoustic or infrasonic to locate a single source where it is reasonable to hypothesize a common source. In its final configuration the infrasonic subsystem will routinely process data from the global 60-station International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasonic network currently under development.},
	Annote = {IDC Goal is to locate 1-kT sources at distances of 2500 km.  The IDC location algorithm uses arrival-dependent weights which are the inverses of the a priori measurements and modeling errors of each error.  The infrasonic travel-time model does not take into account wind along propagation paths, therefore, a large a priori error is assigned to the travel time, and the travel-time component of infrasonic arrivals is given a lower weight than the travel time component of seismic arrivals.  The azimuth of infrasonic arrivals is assigned a low a priori error, therefore it is given more weight.
Signal detection is with a coincidence detector which relies on the normalized cross correlation and the STA/LTA ratio of a beam directed toward the region of the slowness plane with high correlation.  },

	Abstract = {Abstract A catalog that characterizes sources of regional infrasound observed in the western U.S. (1 November 2010 to 31 October 2012) is produced. Data from nine University of Utah Seismograph Stations infrasonic arrays are supplemented by three additional arrays in Nevada, operated by Southern Methodist University. The detection procedure using an adaptive F‐detector provides input into the Bayesian Infrasonic Source Location procedure. The catalog consists of 1510 events with indication of repeated events from many locations such as Dugway Testing Ground, Utah Test and Training Range, and New Bomb. We analyzed the relationship between seasonal variations in the event locations and wind conditions using the Ground‐to‐Space specifications based on publicly available operational numerical weather prediction data analysis products supplement by empirical models above 80 km. There is significant commonality between this study's bulletin and the Western United States Infrasonic Catalog published by Walker et al. (2011). A previous study utilized infrasound signals detected on the USArray Transportable Array seismic stations (2007--2008). Both results document the vast majority of events that occur during working hours, suggesting a human cause. To illustrate the utility of the event bulletin for exploring atmospheric dynamics, propagation paths of an event detected during the equinox period, when the stratospheric wind is low, were generated using a ray‐tracing algorithm. We found that the observations contain stratospheric arrivals, not predicted by ray theory, possibly due to gravity waves increasing the effective jet speed.},

	Abstract = {Automatic infrasound detection is analyzed with infrasonic data from the western US for the time period of November 2010 to October 2012. Data from nine University of Utah Seismograph Stations (UUSS) infrasonic arrays are supplemented by three additional arrays in Nevada, operated by Southern Methodist University (SMU). In this study, the detection procedure is based on an adaptive F-detector (AFD) that accounts for both correlated and uncorrelated noise by capturing the time-varying background noise conditions. The adaptation of the detector, characterized by time varying linear remapping of the F-distribution (C-value), depends on the background noise level at the arrays including weather conditions with seasonal variations and local site effects. The infrasound detection catalog consists of 580,177 signals, depending on time and space as well as data availability at individual stations. Based on the Ground-to-Space (G2S) specifications, the number of detections is shown to be correlated with seasonal variations in the stratospheric winds, illustrating the time varying nature of infrasound propagation. These seasonal variations of infrasound detections include the number of detections, correlation value, occurrences in time, phase velocity, and azimuth. The majority of events occur during working hours, Monday through Friday, suggesting a human cause. Based on the automatic detection results, we reviewed the waveforms generated from the known repeated sources such as Dugway Testing Ground (DTG) and Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) in Utah, and New Bomb (NB) in Nevada. In order to validate the automatic infrasound detection catalog, we document the celerities of automatic infrasound arrivals during the summer and winter using the seismic origin times of NB explosions. Infrasound propagation is dependent on the seasonal variation of wind conditions as well as source location and array distribution.},

The approach is applicable to situations where the unknown noise field remains invariant but the signal field changes, thus allowing for computation of the difference in the two signal covariances.

	Abstract = {Since their development in the 1960s, seismic arrays have given a new impulse to seismology. Recordings from many uniform seismometers in a well‐defined, closely spaced configuration produce high‐quality and homogeneous data sets, which can be used to study the Earth's structure in great detail. Apart from an improvement of the signal‐to‐noise ratio due to the simple summation of the individual array recordings, seismological arrays can be used in many different ways to study the fine‐scale structure of the Earth's interior. They have helped to study such different structures as the interior of volcanos, continental crust and lithosphere, global variations of seismic velocities in the mantle, the core‐mantle boundary and the structure of the inner core. For this purpose many different, specialized array techniques have been developed and applied to an increasing number of high‐quality array data sets. Most array methods use the ability of seismic arrays to measure the vector velocity of an incident wave front, i.e., slowness and back azimuth. This information can be used to distinguish between different seismic phases, separate waves from different seismic events and improve the signal‐to‐noise ratio by stacking with respect to the varying slowness of different phases. The vector velocity information of scattered or reflected phases can be used to determine the region of the Earth from whence the seismic energy comes and with what structures it interacted. Therefore seismic arrays are perfectly suited to study the small‐scale structure and variations of the material properties of the Earth. In this review we will give an introduction to various array techniques which have been developed since the 1960s. For each of these array techniques we give the basic mathematical equations and show examples of applications. The advantages and disadvantages and the appropriate applications and restrictions of the techniques will also be discussed. The main methods discussed are the beam‐forming method, which forms the basis for several other methods, different slant stacking techniques, and frequency--wave number analysis. Finally, some methods used in exploration geophysics that have been adopted for global seismology are introduced. This is followed by a description of temporary and permanent arrays installed in the past, as well as existing arrays and seismic networks. We highlight their purposes and discuss briefly the advantages and disadvantages of different array configurations.},

These timeseries cannot be identified through traditional detection methods.  The goal of this study is to develop a new detector which detects signals based on their coherence across an array, using characteristics of the covariance matrix eigenvalue distribution.  The width of the eigenvalue distribution of the covariance matrix is calculated along a sliding time window at a variety of frequencies.  This method is applied to data from an array of 21 seismometers deployed near the Piton de la Fournaise volcano on Reunion Island.  Results of this analysis demonstrate that seismic wavefield coherence varies with time and frequency, and that coherent events are visible in different frequency bands.  This method is a useful technique for detecting coherent signals of interest from seismic arrays.  },

	Abstract = {We use a method based on the array covariance matrix eigenvalues to study the level of spatial coherence and of isotropy of the seismic wavefield continuously recorded during 2010 by the USArray. First, we observe that the raw data are often dominated by local sources. To remove their influence, we apply spectral and temporal normalizations to the input signals. We notice that this widely used preprocessing in ambient-noise seismology does not fully homogenize the seismic wavefield and that some strongly coherent arrivals persist. Among these persistent signals generated by teleseismic sources we detect (1) seismic waves emitted by strong earthquakes, (2) a nearly continuous quasi-monochromatic signal at 26 s period, and (3) multiday coherent wave trends in the spectral band of oceanic microseisms (0.07--0.2 Hz). For the latter, beamforming analysis shows that while most of the signals are composed of surface waves, some are dominated by body waves likely generated in the deep ocean.},
	Annote = {A method based on the array covariance matrix eigenvalues is used to study spatial coherence of waveforms recorded in 2010 by the USArray.  This method is applied because sources lying under the array cannot be assumed to be arriving as plane waves, and because the background noise often influences beamforming output.  The method aims to separate the signal and noise subspaces based on the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix.  Results from processing one year of data with this method suggest that the covariance matrix contains traces from multiple sources, including microseismic sources.  },

@article{Wax:1992,
	Annote = {Authors propose a minimum description length (MDL) principle, applicable to detection and localization of coherent and noncoherent noise sources.  The description length is computed by summing the description length of the noise subspace components, the description length of the signal subspace components, and the descriptive length of k.  This technique outperforms similar localization techniques in both the presence of coherent noise, and in scenarios where the signal-to-noise ratio is low; however, the estimator is asymptotically biased.  This bias results in a fixed probability of correct detection even as the number of samples grows.},
